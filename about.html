			<h2>Hyperautomation</h2>
			<p>Hyperautomation brings together several components of process automation, 
			integrating tools and technologies that amplify the ability to automate work.
			It starts with robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, and expands automation 
			capability with artificial intelligence (AI), process mining, analytics, and 
			other advanced tools. The idea is to automate more and more knowledge work, 
			and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation.

			<h2>Multiexperience</h2>
			<p>MXDPs serve to centralize life cycle activities — designing, developing, 
			testing, distributing, managing and analyzing — for a portfolio of multiexperience 
			apps. Multiexperience refers to the various permutations of modalities (e.g., 
			touch, voice and gesture), devices and apps that users interact with on their 
			digital journey across the various touchpoints. Multiexperience development 
			involves creating fit-for-purpose apps based on touchpoint-specific modalities, 
			while at the same time ensuring a consistent user experience across web, mobile,
			wearable, conversational and immersive touchpoints.
